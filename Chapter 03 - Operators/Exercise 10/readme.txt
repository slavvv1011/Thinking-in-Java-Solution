Write a program with two constant values, one with alternating binary ones and zeroes,
with a zero in the least-significant digit, and the second, also alternating,
with a one in the least-significant digit (hint: It's easiest to use
hexadecimal constants for this). Take these two values and combine them
in all possible ways using the bitwise operators, and display the results
using Integer.toBinaryString().
